description: next-forge ships with a Cloudflare-based inspector that lets you override feature flags in development.
---

The Cloudflare feature flag inspector is a lightweight script you can host alongside your Worker. It renders a floating toolbar that talks to the `/.well-known/feature-flags` endpoint in each app so you can flip flag values while previewing new builds.

## Host the inspector script

Deploy a Worker that serves a JavaScript bundle for the inspector UI. You can reuse the same Worker that powers your feature flag API â€“ just expose the bundle at a stable URL such as `/toolbar.js`.

## Configure your applications

Add the inspector URL to each application's environment so the shared toolbar component knows where to load it from:

```env title=".env.local"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FLAGS_TOOLBAR_SCRIPT_URL="https://flags.example.workers.dev/toolbar.js"
```

Protect the `/.well-known/feature-flags` route with a shared secret so only the inspector can read definitions:

```env title=".env.local"
FLAGS_SECRET="test"
```

You can now open the toolbar in any environment by clicking the "Flags" icon that appears once the inspector script loads.
