next-forge comes with three web analytics libraries.

## Cloudflare Web Analytics

Cloudflare Web Analytics provides privacy-first insights about page views, referrers, and engagement without shipping cookies or tracking scripts that slow down your site. Add your site's beacon token to `NEXT_PUBLIC_CF_WEB_ANALYTICS_TOKEN` and the shared analytics provider will automatically load Cloudflare's script in every app.

Read more about it [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/web-analytics/get-started/).

## Google Analytics

Google Analytics tracks user behavior, page views, session duration, and other engagement metrics to provide insights into user activity and marketing effectiveness. GA tracking code is injected using [@next/third-parties](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/third-party-libraries#google-analytics) for performance reasons.

To enable it, simply add a `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` environment variable to your project.

## PostHog

PostHog is a single platform to analyze, test, observe, and deploy new features. It comes with lots of products, including a web analytics tool, event analytics, feature flagging, and more.

PostHog's web analytics tool is enabled by default and captures pageviews, pageleave and custom events.

### Session Replay

PostHog's session replays let you see exactly what users do on your site. It records console logs and network errors, and captures performance data like resource timings and blocked requests. This is disabled by default, so make sure you enable it in your project settings.
