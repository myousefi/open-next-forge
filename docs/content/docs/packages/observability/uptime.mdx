title: Uptime Monitoring
description: How we've configured uptime monitoring in next-forge.
---

Uptime monitoring can be powered by any service that exposes a simple status endpoint. We recommend creating a lightweight Workers route that aggregates the health of your application (for example, by checking cached results from Cloudflare Load Balancer health checks or internal probes) and returning a JSON payload in the following shape:

```json title="Example status payload"
{
  "status": "operational",
  "label": "All systems normal",
  "url": "https://status.next-forge.com"
}
```

## Using the Status component

next-forge provides a `Status` component from `@repo/observability` that displays the current status of the application. You can see an example of this in the website footer.

The status component recognises the following `status` values:

- `operational` or `ok` – renders `All systems normal`
- `degraded`, `partial`, or `partial_outage` – renders `Partial outage`
- `down` or `outage` – renders `Degraded performance`
- any other value – renders `Status unknown`

You can override the text by providing a `label` field and optionally direct users to a status page with the `url` field.

Expose the endpoint URL via the `OBSERVABILITY_STATUS_ENDPOINT` environment variable in each app that renders the status component.
